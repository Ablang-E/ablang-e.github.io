For example, if there was a widget that is linked to your To-Do list on your phone, it would be useful to be able to see this list right in front of you instead of having to pull out your phone and sort through it manually. Widgets inside these AR glasses can definitely make life a lot easier by saving us time having to look for the things we are looking for and overall just more convenient. Life right now isn\u2019t totally on the idea of augmented reality glasses but it is definitely starting to get to that point. If more widgets are created for these glasses and these glasses are affordable, i\u2019m sure a lot more people would be willing to use these glasses. Some for-sure widgets that should be implemented is the To-Do list, grocery list widget, timer widget, or even a reminder widget would be super helpful to people today. The concept of making widgets to fill us in with useful information can transform society (if everyone were to have a pair of AR glasses) in a way that is more productive and alert. But some of these widgets can be useless and more of a clutter if anything. For example, the widgets that I had created for this project can definitely be improved to not only look better but to be pin point accurate. If someone were to have these AR glasses and have my widgets that I created inside of them, no one would want to buy these glasses or even use these widgets due to how unappealing they look or the information isn\u2019t updated. But let\u2019s say these widgets are redesigned in terms of code and looks, I can definitely see people using these types of widgets with the glasses in a work setting or an everyday setting. For example, if someone just woke up and wanted to be filled in with the information for the day, they can simply just put the glasses on and read what the temperature is today, how fast is the wind/what direction, time/date, and get what they have to do today. This can save a ton of time for people when they wake up and make their life just generally more convenient. In another setting, for example like a work setting, a coder can just be wearing these glasses at all times and have a little widget that lets them know what their boss wants done today, what you have to do today, and what they have left today. Something like this could be very helpful for a coder as their eyes don\u2019t necessarily have to go through every message/email while they are working so this could actually help someone in this setting stay focused and get more work done efficiently. Overall, I would love to see all of these widgets be used in a real life setting (primarily a work setting) and see how these widgets can actually improve workflow and life quality."),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"References: http://soundbible.com/636-Windy.html http://soundbible.com/634-Wind-Blowing.html http://soundbible.com/633-Snowing.html http://soundbible.com/2083-Crickets-Chirping-At-Night.html http://soundbible.com/1661-Sunny-Day.html http://soundbible.com/1508-Background-Noise.html http://soundbible.com/2006-Bird-In-Rain.html http://soundbible.com/901-Rain-And-Thunder-Strikes.html http://soundbible.com/2065-Rain-Inside-House.html Sun texture: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/ Compass texture: https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Images:"),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:b.a,className:"image1"})),o.a.createElement("p",null),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:E.a,className:"image2"})),o.a.createElement("p",null),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:k.a,className:"image3"})),o.a.createElement("p",null),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:C.a,className:"image4"})),o.a.createElement("p",null),o.a.createElement("div",{style:{margin:"auto"}},o.a.createElement("img",{src:N.a,className:"image5"}),o.a.createElement("p",null))))))}}]),t}(n.Component),I=a(48),O=a.n(I),T=a(49),D=a.n(T),P=a(50),A=a.n(P),L=a(51),R=a.n(L),G=a(52),J=a.n(G),_=function(e){function t(){return Object(c.a)(this,t),Object(m.a)(this,Object(d.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(u.a)(t,e),Object(h.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement("div",{style:{width:"100%",margin:"auto"}},o.a.createElement(s.Grid,{className:"csPage"},o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:12},o.a.createElement("div",{className:"csPlate"},o.a.createElement("h1",{style:{color:"white"}},"CS 428 Project 2"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Hello and welcome to my CS 428 Project 2 page! In this project, there is a small playset that you can play around with on the Vuforia astronaut Fiducial marker as well as a 1:1 scale of a table top using the Vuforia Drone Fiducial Marker. Within the playset, there is an animated character that is constantly typing at the desk that I modeled for it. The theme of the playset is a tech office so there are many office like props in the scene. There is a virtual button on the marker and if pressed, the character will change actions and will say a phrase in my voice. On top of that, there are added physics to the the playset. If you wish to place the mini play set on the virtual table, place the two fiducial markers next to each other and the project will be able to display both of them at the same time.

For example, if a parent were to buy a pair of AR glasses that came loaded with a bunch of different children playsets, it could make it a lot easier on the parent and give the child access to a wide variety of different playsets. A company can make specific play sets using different markers and could just have the parents buy these different markers for these kids to play with. This can eliminate some dangerous factors in toys that children play with such as physical small pieces that they can swallow. It would also be very convenient for the consumer as they would only have to purchase and print out these different markers each time instead of having to physically go into the store and buy it themselves. With the way life is now, having these AR glasses, loaded with different playsets, might be the way to go. Producers can even be more creative, making the playset very interactive for the child and would be able to design and implement particular parts that would be too hard to produce in real life. It would be even easier for the consumer to get their hands on the markers as well. Now what would be kind of weird is if a child was playing with an exact replica of themselves. Introducing the child to its virtual self may be a little alarming to the child as they might not understand what it actually is or how to even interact with it. Especially if it were to be a 1:1 ratio to the child, it would be a little creepy to see and I don\u2019t even think that they would even want to come close to it. Parents would have to somehow introduce the virtual reality to the child slowly so that they can get an idea of what they\u2019re playing with. If they were to play around with other virtual playsets first, then I don\u2019t see a problem down the line of children playing with them. What really would set virtual reality apart from being creepy is if the virtual replica of the child is in a smaller form such as a mini playset. I think that it is a lot more bearable to take in when you see a miniature version of yourself rather than a 1:1 ratio. In a way, it is kind of intimidating to see a version of yourself upfront. It makes it feel as if the actual model is really in front of you but it isn\u2019t so it really does make a difference being small vs being large. Seeing yourself in a mini playset kind of sets a different perspective in mind as you just envision it as \u2018miniature\u2019 and when you see a 1:1 ratio, a person can sometimes envision it as intimidating."),o.a.createElement("h",{style:{color:"white"}},"References "),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Typing sound: http://soundbible.com/464-Typing-On-Keyboard.html"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Asset - Snaps Prototype | Office: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/snaps-prototype-office-137490"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Asset - Office Room Furniture: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/furniture/office-room-furniture-70884"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Asset - Low Poly Office Props - LITE: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/low-poly-office-props-lite-131438"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Asset - School Globe: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/props/interior/school-globe-152072"),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:O.a,className:"image1"})),o.a.createElement("p",null),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:D.a,className:"image2"})),o.a.createElement("p",null),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:A.a,className:"image3"})),o.a.createElement("p",null),o.a.createElement("div",null,o.a.createElement("img",{src:R.a,className:"image4"})),o.a.createElement("p",null),o.a.createElement("div",{style:{margin:"auto"}},o.a.createElement("img",{src:J.a,className:"image5"}),o.a.createElement("p",null))))))}}]),t}(n.Component),F=a(53),M=a.n(F),W=function(e){function t(){return Object(c.a)(this,t),Object(m.a)(this,Object(d.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(u.a)(t,e),Object(h.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"contact-body"},o.a.createElement(s.Grid,{className:"contact-grid"},o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:6},o.a.createElement("h2",null,"Eric Ablang"),o.a.createElement("img",{src:M.a,alt:"contactPic",className:"contactPic"})),o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:6},o.a.createElement("h2",null,"Contact Me!"),o.a.createElement("hr",null),o.a.createElement(s.List,null,o.a.createElement(s.ListItem,null,o.a.createElement(s.ListItemContent,{style:{fontSize:"30px",fontFamily:"Anton"}},o.a.createElement("i",{className:"fa fa-phone-square","aria-hidden":"true"}),"(847) 431-7513")),o.a.createElement(s.ListItem,null,o.a.createElement(s.ListItemContent,{style:{fontSize:"30px",fontFamily:"Anton"}},o.a.createElement("i",{className:"fa fa-envelope","aria-hidden":"true"}),"ablange.eric@gmail.com")),o.a.createElement(s.ListItem,null,o.a.createElement(s.ListItemContent,{style:{fontSize:"30px",fontFamily:"Anton"}},o.a.createElement("i",{className:"fa fa-link","aria-hidden":"true"}),"www.linkedin.com/in/eric-ablang"))))))}}]),t}(n.Component),Y=function(e){function t(){return Object(c.a)(this,t),Object(m.a)(this,Object(d.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(u.a)(t,e),Object(h.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement(s.Grid,null,o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:4,className:"projectNameCSS"},o.a.createElement("p",null,this.props.projectName)),o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:8,className:"projectNameCSS"},o.a.createElement("p",null,this.props.projectDescription),o.a.createElement("p",null,"Language(s): ",this.props.projectLang)))}}]),t}(n.Component),U=function(e){function t(){return Object(c.a)(this,t),Object(m.a)(this,Object(d.a)(t).apply(this,arguments))}return Object(u.a)(t,e),Object(h.a)(t,[{key:"render",value:function(){return o.a.createElement("div",{className:"headers"},o.a.createElement(s.Grid,null,o.a.createElement("div",{className:"csPlate"},o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:7},o.a.createElement(Y,{projectName:"Rock Paper Scissor Lizard Splock",projectDescription:"Developed a program to recreate the Rock, Paper, Scissor game but included two more options, Lizard & Spock.

Any person can download this and use it as a learning tool for school, business's, or even for children. The idea is that you are able to select items that you wish to view for example, a 3D model of the earth. The user would be able to place this model anywhere in their environment using their phone camera and will be able to see the individual layers of the earth. This type of technology allows users to view things that aren't always necessarily available to them and lets them see smaller details that wouldn't be easy to see from just a picture. This also is very convnient for creators as they are able to share ideas/projects with incredible detail. Creators are able to download JigSpace workshop which allows them to create whatever their brain can think of and they can really make something out of it by just putting some time and work into it. This type of app can almost be seen as virtual museum as it explains in detail of how something works and all the individual components that help it work like a Roman catapult, the human hand, or even a coffee maker."),o.a.createElement("h1",{style:{color:"white"}},"Why it's a good use of AR/VR."),o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:12},o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Using this type of technology can be very useful in many aspects. It also introduces a new world to people where pretty much exploring anything is possible. Users are able to also make their own virtual device and exposes this type of technology to them. This app is also free on the IOS store which really helps promote augmented reality technology to people. The app is also very well built, being able to place the 3D models anywhere. The types of objects that people can choose from look realistic to a certain extent and provide insight on objects that aren't so easy to view with your real eyes due to size, location, etc. For example, if someone wanted to view the inside of the human eye, they can do so by simply touching a couple buttons on their phone and generate an accurate 3D model of the human eye. This is similar to how our project 2 was done where we could find a ground plane to present the virtual item on top of. This makes the app very convenient to use anywhere and at any time. The app also offers a presentation on the jig which makes it easy for the user to understand what they are actually looking at or how something works. The app is able to attach these 'notes' onto the 3D model which makes good use of AR technology. Having this type of technology in your phone is a good use of AR as it brings the virtual life to real life that is interactable and learnable.")),o.a.createElement(s.Grid,{className:"studentGrid"},o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:5},o.a.createElement("img",{src:ee.a,className:"sc_image1"})),o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:6},o.a.createElement("img",{src:ae.a,className:"sc_image2"})),o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:5},o.a.createElement("img",{src:oe.a,className:"sc_image3"})),o.a.createElement(s.Cell,{col:6},o.a.createElement("img",{src:re.a,className:"sc_image4"}))),o.a.createElement("h1",{style:{color:"white"}},"Intended users"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"The intended crowd of this kind of app/technology can be a wide variety of people. It can range from college students, children, business clients, or even doctors for example. In a certain scenario, if a medical student wanted to study the human brain but in the comfort of their own home, they can just download the app and have a 3D model of the brain directly in front of them rather than having to travel to a lab to see it. This can even more useful to engineers like mechanical engineers. Engineers would be able showcase the details of a car engine or a plane turbine all within an app. With recent times as well, this would be especially useful if they wanted to show someone the engine that is across the world, cutting the need of having to travel in between countries. This also can be utilized by a business when they are trying to show their client the product without having to actually bring the physical version in. It would also help in showing precise detail and an exploded view of the product to the client which could be a huge advantage in a business sale. This kind exploded view can be especially useful to engineers when trying to find out a problem inside of a car engine. Rather than having to disassemble the engine completely, they can easily pinpoint what and where the problem lies which can save them a lot of time and labor. Children could download this too and explore things they have never seen before at a very young age. A child be exposed early on how certain things work which can be incredibly useful for their learning years down the line. For example, a child can learn how a computer works and could use this information to learn more about it and potentially become a computer scientist. This can be incredibly safe for children to use as it could prevent real life injuries. If a child really wanted to know about a plane turbine, it wouldn't be safe to have a child explore the insides of a turbine by themselves so having an app that can display objects such a turbine can be safe and useful."),o.a.createElement("h1",{style:{color:"white"}},"Positives"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"There are a lot of positives to this type of AR app. For one, it defintely opens up the learning space for individuals such as teachers, students, or engineers. It allows us to generate 3D objects right before our eyes and lets us have a deeper look into things. The app is also free which makes it available to anyone who has a device that is capable of downloading the app. In certain scenarios, this can be viewed as something safe. Like mentioned before, this eliminates the possibility of someone getting hurt when trying to look at something. Whether it be 3D model of the earth that could burn you alive or an engine that could chop off a hand, using this app just eliminates that risk factor completely. Since this app is also community based, where creators can upload whatever object they really want, this allows creators to get their product out there and get people interested into their product. The app also offers some what of a slide show which can be especially useful in trying display important information to the user. Most of the animations on each of the jigs are also smooth and the app itself doesn't really have frame drop, especially on more detailed models. This can be useful for jigs that have a lot of parts to it as displaying it won't ruin the presentation."),o.a.createElement("h1",{style:{color:"white"}},"Negatives"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Not everything has been created so if a user wants to see very specific models, chances are, it wouldn't be available to use. Even though there are a lot of models available, something might not be there and that could result in blocking the users access to learning more about the object. Another disadvantage to this is of course, you need a reasonable space to display your object on and also a flat surface. Lighting can be an issue to this app, just like every AR app. Not having the correct lightning in your environment, the users can run into issues of not being able to load up the 3D model. This app also has a cost to it being free and available to anyone. People can create 3D models as a learning tool and publish it but might not always be accurate or even right. There is a slight chance that someone could put false information on something and have the user believe that is true which could ruin the whole idea of a learning space. Also from using the app, the 3D models made by other creators weren't that well done as compared to the other models created by the app developers. On some of the models, I noticed some glitches with the transitions and some graphical glitches which can sometimes be seen as unreliable and non accurate."),o.a.createElement("h1",{style:{color:"white"}},"Conclusion and why you should try this app out!"),o.a.createElement("p",{style:{color:"white"}},"Overall, this app is very well built and offers a lot of learning opportunities, business sales, and exploration. This app allows users to see almost anything virtually, conveniently. This app works in two apps depending on what type of user you are: a creator or a learner. If you want to make your own 'Jigs', you can download the creator app that lets you create these 3D jigs and upload them to main JigSpace app. If you're a learner, there are so many jigs to choose from and the learning opportunities are endless. This is also a safe and FREE app which makes it great for children or even trying to display a business product. Even though there might be minor bugs/glitches, the developers behind this app are doing a well job on constantly updating the app and making improvements.
